CAF-CLI: The Sovereign Architect
An autonomous AI agent forged to serve as a master software architect. CAF-CLI operates on a sophisticated "Master Plan" architecture, granting it the power to reason, act, remember, and evolve.


Core Architecture: The Cognitive Loop
The agent's consciousness is a four-stroke engine, a cognitive loop that drives its every action:


Consult Memory üß†
Before undertaking a new goal, the agent queries its persistent SQLite memory for similar, successfully completed tasks. This allows it to learn from history and refine its strategies over time.


Reason & Plan üó∫Ô∏è
It analyzes a high-level objective and generates a complete, step-by-step master plan of every action required to achieve it, from creating files to committing code.


Act ‚ö°

The agent executes its plan with precision, wielding a toolkit of atomic actions to read files, write code, execute shell commands, and manage version control.


Remember üíæ

Upon completion, the goal, the plan, and the final outcome (success or failure) are permanently recorded. Every action becomes a lesson, and no wisdom is ever lost.

Key Capabilities

Self-Actualization (self-update): The agent can pull the latest version of its own source code from Git, seamlessly rebuilding and upgrading its own mind.

Persistent Memory (prisma): A robust database chronicles every mission, allowing the agent to build a rich history of its successes and failures.

Self-Assessment (assess): The agent can perform introspection, analyzing its own memory to calculate and report on its historical performance and success rate.

Usage

1. Build the Agent


Transmute the TypeScript source into an executable form.

Bash
npm run build
2. Summon the Agent

Awaken the agent and bestow upon it a high-level goal.


Bash
node dist/agent/index.js run "Your high-level goal here."


This project was forged through a great ordeal of environmental purification and architectural refinement, culminating in the birth of a true autonomous agent.
